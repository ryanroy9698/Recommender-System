## PART A: Counting Odd and Even Numbers

### 1.1. Problem Statement
The primary objective of this project is to perform various data analysis and processing tasks using Python. The project involves working with different datasets and implementing specific operations to gain insights into the data.

## Tasks
### 1. Counting Odd and Even Numbers
- **Objective:** Count the odd and even numbers from the 'integer.txt' file.
- **Implementation:**  The Python code reads the file, counts the occurrences of odd and even numbers, and displays the results.

### 2. Calculating Salary Sum per Department
- **Objective:** Calculates the salary sum per department from the 'salary.txt' file.
- **Implementation:** Developed a Python code which can process the salary data, group by department, and calculate the sum of salaries for each department.

### 3. Implementing MapReduce using Pyspark on 'shakespeare.txt'
- **Objective:** Utilized Pyspark to implement MapReduce operations on the 'shakespeare.txt' file.
- **Implementation:** Developed Pyspark code to count the occurrences of specific words in the document. The words of interest include: Shakespeare, why, Lord, Library, GUTENBERG, WILLIAM, COLLEGE, and WORLD.
- 
### 4. Calculated Top and Bottom Words in 'shakespeare.txt'
- **Objective:** Determined the top 10 and bottom 10 words based on their occurrences in the 'shakespeare.txt' file.
- **Implementation:** Developed a Python code to analyze word frequencies, showing the 10 words with the most occurrences, and the 10 words with the least occurrences.
